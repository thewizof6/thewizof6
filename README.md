# About Me

## My _Elevator Pitch_: 

Adept communication systems engineer and military veteran with experience in communication operations, Quality (QA) engineering and management, technical support, and site reliability engineering.  Ensuring the delivery of high-quality products and services is my primary focus.  Whether performing routine operational quality tests, verifying design and engineering quality, designing systems, or supporting customers to maintain promised Service Level Agreements (SLAs), I always strive to meet the highest standards of performance, usability, and service, satisfying both company and customer requirements.

## Career Summary:
I started in the U.S Air Force as a _Communications - Computer Systems Control Technician_ (3C2711), where telecommunications installation, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance became second nature.   That prepared me for the next 30 years working with digital video encoding, broadcasting, distribution, streaming, and supporting technologies.  Video has been my favorite data medium because the feedback is immediate and visual, uncomplicated (on the surface).

## Where I am today:

* I am near retirement age and considering retiring early to stay home to assist my wife.

* I live on a small family farm with my extended family.

* Working with my hands has always been a passion - woodworking, auto mechanics, home maintenance, and more.  I recently started sharpening knives and tools as a side hustle.

* My immediate technical goal is to learn IoT implementation for small farm applications.  An interview with a company that specializes in MQTT introduced me to IoT and its vast potential.  My preferred language is **Python**. I am also learning **HTML **, ** CSS **, and ** JavaScript** in Udacity's Web Front-end Development program.
